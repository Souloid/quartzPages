I'm going to be writing about my experience trying to setup this project.

It all started with a moment of inspiration for sharing what I've learned. I thought to myself: there should be a simple and FREE way for me to share my knowledge so that others can benefit from my curiosity fueled rabbit holes. 

Well~ here we are~ 

I found a couple of resources that seem to do the job:
1. Static websites are cheap to deploy (computationally inexpensive so even a toaster can run it)
2. One way to build them is to use markdown files (which I am using in Obsidian)
3. I can use Hugo (requires learning how to setup a website and I've a migraine so~ skipping it for today) 
4. ANOTHER way is to use a project called **Quartz** to transform my Obsidian Notes into webpages.
5. Github pages allow you to publish a static website using a repo so why not.

TLDR: I wanna publish knowledge in a free website so I used github pages to host my obsidian notes.

A website is basically a piece of content that is formatted using html, stored in a webserver, and sent to anyone who tries to visit it. 

To get this done we're going to do things in 3 steps:
1. Design the web page(s) using Obsidian
2. Transform these pages into websites using Quartz
3. Host them online so people can get them using GitHub Pages (Cause like all knowledge it ***should*** be FREE~)
