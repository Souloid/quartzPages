# Buy (rent) A Domain
To get your own website address you gotta buy it/rent it. I like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) but you can find your own if you don't like it. 

When you have your own domain name let's make it send people who visit it off to our website that we built :3 (that github is hosting)

# Configuring DNS
DNS stands for (Domain Name Service) meaning it sends our PC the IP address it should go to when we visit the "Domain Name" (aka website address) we gave it. 

Depending on which service you used to rent your domain name, the instuctions look different. So just look up how to set your -seller- domain to github pages.

In my case since i used Namecheap I found these two resources to help me do it.
1. [GitHub Docs about hosting pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)
2. [Namecheap page about configuring GitHub Pages](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/)

# Setting the custom domain for github pages
Go to your github repo, settings, pages, and under custom domain type in your new shiny domain that you bought. 
Click Save and you're done.

It might take a while, but if you visit that address in the future you will find your github pages that you just created.

Enjoy :D
